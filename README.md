# xiphos

The `xiphos` (\ˈksiːfoʊs/ KSEE-fohss; Greek: ξίφος) is a double-edged, one-handed Iron Age straight shortsword used by the ancient Greeks.
It was a secondary battlefield weapon for the Greek armies after the dory or javelin.  
The classic blade was generally about 45–60 cm (18–24 in) long, although the Spartans supposedly started to use blades as short as 30 cm (12 in) around the era of the Greco-Persian Wars.  
The xiphos sometimes has a midrib, and is diamond or lenticular in cross-section.  
It was generally hung from a baldric under the left arm.  
The xiphos was generally used only when the spear was broken, taken by the enemy, or discarded for close combat.  
Very few xiphoi seem to have survived.
